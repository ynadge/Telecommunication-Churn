# Telecommunication Company Churn Prediction

Processing customer data using the CatBoost algorithm to predict whether a customer will churn. 

## Motivation and Problem Significance

Customer churn is a significant challenge for businesses across various industries. Losing customers can lead to substantial revenue loss, increased customer acquisition costs, and damage to brand reputation. By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can proactively implement retention strategies to minimize customer attrition.

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can effectively predict customer churn. By leveraging the powerful CatBoost algorithm, we can efficiently handle the categorical nature of customer data and build a highly accurate predictive model. This model will enable businesses to identify at-risk customers and take timely actions to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and driving business growth.
